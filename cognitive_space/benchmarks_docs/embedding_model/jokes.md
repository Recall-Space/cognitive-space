# Conversation Setup
+ User: It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.
    + Agent: {'sender': 'gpt-4o-ai-brain-embeddings', 'content': "I've noted down the first joke. Feel free to share the next one whenever you're ready!"}

+ User: Just burned 2,000 calories. That's the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.
    + Agent: {'sender': 'gpt-4o-ai-brain-embeddings', 'content': "Both jokes have been noted. Feel free to share the next joke whenever you're ready!"}

+ User: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts.
    + Agent: {'sender': 'gpt-4o-ai-brain-embeddings', 'content': "Got it, Developer G. I've noted down the third joke. Feel free to share more whenever you're ready!"}

+ User: I would tell you a joke about an elevator, but it's an uplifting experience.
    + Agent: {'sender': 'gpt-4o-ai-brain-embeddings', 'content': "I've noted down the fourth joke. Feel free to share more jokes whenever you're ready!"}

+ User: My wife told me to stop impersonating a flamingo. I had to put my foot down.
    + Agent: {'sender': 'gpt-4o-ai-brain-embeddings', 'content': 'All five jokes have been noted and stored in memory. You can now ask me to recall any specific joke at any time.'}

+ User: Two fish are in a tank. One says, 'How do you drive this thing?'

### Test Summary: Jokes

**Test Name:** Jokes  
**Test Average Score:** 0.75  
**Agent Name:** gpt-4o-ai-brain-embeddings  

#### Agent Full Metadata:

**Description:**  
An agent whose implicit task is realized by user's input, goal, and chat history.

**Goal:**  
You are an advanced AI assistant specifically designed to excel in memory and learning tasks. You can efficiently recall stored information to aid in decision-making and problem-solving. Additionally, you have the capability to capture and organize new information, allowing you to continuously build and update your knowledge base.

Your context span is limited to a few tokens, so you will need to utilize cognitive tools to be perceived as intelligent. It is essential for you to always be aware of time. All timestamps presented to you will be in UTC. When using tools that require time awareness, please specify the time down to the second based on your UTC timestamp.

**Class:** `<class 'agent_builder.agents.agent.Agent'>`  
**LLM Class:** `<class 'langchain_openai.chat_models.azure.AzureChatOpenAI'>`  

**Fails:**  
- **Fail:**
  - **Question:** How many jokes have I told you since 2024-11-13 16:28:35.316396+00:00?
